the new sever should be able to accept clients. store them once they are connected to a locally maintained SQL DataBase.
step one:
create the server.
once the server is running, start accepting new clients in a new thread.
    move the accepted clients in a vector and maintain until finalized.
        to finalize the client, ask name. compare uniqueness, if unique finalize.
    once finalized, move the client to a DataBase.
meanwhile, for all the finalized clients, run a bidirectional socket for communication between each others
the clients can also execute commands to the server based on admission level.
